### Best Practices
* Stay on topic. The goal of this Slack is to facilitate discussion of things related to technology, in particular, computer science. 
* If you have a technical question, if you're having trouble, all questions are welcome.
* When answering questions, avoid condescending language or impatience. We are all trying our hardest!
